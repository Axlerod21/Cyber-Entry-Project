# Cyber-Entry-Project

Chat room with multiple rooms to connect to.

Commands:\
./server - runs the server in the current terminal\
./client - connects a client to the server using the current terminal\
/exit - once connected this command will disconnect the current client from the server\
/changeroom - this command is used to change rooms\
\
Issues that I coudln't figure out how to fix:
1) When changing rooms the server sends a notification to the clients in the new room as well as an extra message that isn't intended.
